/* CPU_step() will execute a single machine instruction on our sCPU. CPU step(). Takes 
a uint8_t opcode, three additional uint8_ts called arg1, arg2, and arg3, as well as a 
pointer to an sCPU.
    print instruction: executed when the opcode is 0. Prints the value held in the 0th register.

    put instruction: executed when the opcode is 1. Treats arg2 and arg3 as a single immediate, 
    and places its value in the register indicated by arg1. In other words, it should set 
    reg[arg1] = x, where x is a 32-bit integer formed by concatenating 16 zeros followed by 
    the bits of arg2 and arg3.

    add instruction: executed when the opcode is 2. Takes the values in the registers indicated 
    by arg2 and arg3, adds them, and places their sum into the register indicated by arg1.

    mul instruction: executed when the opcode is 5. Does the same as add but with multiplication.

    store instruction: executed when the opcode is 3. Takes the value in the register indicated 
    by arg1, and place it in the ith place in RAM, where i is the value stored in the register 
    indicated by arg2.

    load instruction: executed when the opcode is 4. Takes the value stored in the ith place in 
    RAM, where i is the value stored in the register indicated by arg2, and places it in the 
    register indicated by arg1.
